# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- `device.connection: tcp` — connect the BBS to a [pyMC_Repeater](https://github.com/pyMC-dev/pyMC_Repeater) companion over TCP (`tcp_host`, `tcp_port`) while keeping `connection: serial` for USB companions
- [docs/PYMC_MIGRATION.md](docs/PYMC_MIGRATION.md) — identity export from the old companion and pyMC/Docker setup

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Web dashboard **Boards** tab: list/create/delete boards and view/add/delete posts via `/api/boards` and `/api/boards/{slug}/posts`
- Web dashboard **Users** tab: full user directory (all users, not limited like mesh WHO) with CoreScope node links (`/api/users`)

### Fixed
- Deleting a board now removes its post rows first so SQLite foreign-key enforcement no longer blocks removal when posts exist

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Mail “online” presence now includes any mesh activity attributed to a user (overheard adverts, path updates, public-channel posts, and flood traffic), not only DMs to the BBS — so inbox notifications can reach users who are active on the mesh without polling the BBS

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- Web dashboard usage charts show the numeric value above each bar (no hover needed)
- `PING` / `PONG` again includes the mesh path when path discovery returns only the outbound leg, or when the contact’s stored route is available

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- Web dashboard log SSE stream (`/api/logs/stream`) no longer logs `ClientConnectionResetError` when the browser closes the connection (tab switch, follow toggle, or page leave)

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Dashboard queue row actions: **Remove** (cancel message), **Pause 30m** (defer all outbound to that recipient for 30 minutes), **To back** (manual requeue)

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Web dashboard **Queue** tab and `GET /api/queue`: pending outbound messages with recipient, resolved mesh path, message type (response / notification / retry), triggering command, and body preview

### Changed
- Outbound send retries and per-recipient throttle deferrals move the row to the **back** of the pending queue (same priority) so a flaky node does not starve other recipients

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Admin `ADVERT` command triggers a flood mesh advertisement
- Web dashboard button on Overview to send a flood advertisement (`POST /api/advert`)

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- Web dashboard shows Last event and Queue in the top bar on every tab
- Usage charts render bar heights correctly (active/new users by day)
- Log tab can hide `aiohttp.access` lines from the dashboard’s own polling

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- Web dashboard log tab now expands to fill the available viewport (full width and height) instead of a fixed 420px panel inside a 1200px column

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Display names may include Unicode emoji (common on MeshCore handles)
- `SEND` accepts partial display-name matches (e.g. `SEND VK2VSR` → `🗼VK2VSR`); replies `! Ambiguous: …` when several users match

### Changed
- `NAME` help and welcome text mention emoji in allowed characters

### Fixed
- `PING` again includes the full inbound mesh path in `PONG` replies, with relay hashes resolved to contact names where known (via path discovery when not present on the packet)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Web dashboard on the health HTTP port (`/` redirects to `/dashboard`): live BBS status, usage charts, activity tables, and a log tail tab
- JSON API under `/api/status`, `/api/stats`, `/api/activity`, `/api/history`, and `/api/logs` (plus SSE log stream at `/api/logs/stream`)
- `/health` now returns the same rich status payload used by the dashboard (still 200/503 for container health checks)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `PING` command: BBS replies `PONG` with hop count and the full mesh relay path, with node pubkey prefixes resolved to contact names where known
- `WHO` command now shows last known hop count per user (e.g. `alice (5min ago 2hop)`)
- Weather output now includes a Unicode icon matching the WMO weather code and a daily precipitation probability percentage (e.g. `⛅ partly cloudy 22°C 💧40% 💨NE 15km/h`)

### Changed
- `last_hops` column added to `users` table (DB migration 2) — stored on every inbound message

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `WHO` command: lists the 5 most recently active users with relative time
- Admin DM notification when a new user connects for the first time
- Hop-proportional rate limiting: direct (hops=0) and admins bypass limits entirely; 1 hop → 4× limit, 2 hops → 2×, 3+ hops → base limit
- Inbound message logging now includes display name, pubkey prefix, hop count, and body preview
- Command dispatch logging: verb and caller logged on every command

### Changed
- Weather switched from Bureau of Meteorology to [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) — free, no API key, no blocking; configured via lat/lon instead of BOM station ID
- Docker build migrated from pip to uv; added a `test` stage that runs the full suite on every build
- `STATUS` help text now explicitly mentions outbound queue depth
- Version read from package metadata (`importlib.metadata`) — single source of truth in `pyproject.toml`

### Fixed
- BOM 403 errors on news/weather fetches (now resolved by switching weather source; BOM RSS feeds can be removed from config)
- `VACUUM` crash: `cannot VACUUM from within a transaction` — now commits before vacuuming and swallows lock errors with a warning
- `docker restart` not picking up new images — documented and replaced with `docker compose ... up -d`

---
